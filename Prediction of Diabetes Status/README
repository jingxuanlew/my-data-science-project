#Diabetes Prediction Model
## Overview
Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, significantly impacting public health. The increase in diabetes cases has led to a rising demand for effective methods to understand the various factors contributing to its widespread occurrence. This project aims to explore the factors influencing diabetes prevalence, focusing on identifying the risk factors and health outcomes related to the condition. Through this analysis, we aim to predict a person's diabetes status by determining the best-performing classification model, helping in early detection and intervention.

## Objective
Investigate the prevalence of diabetes and its contributing risk factors.
Identify the best machine learning classification model to predict the diabetes status of individuals.

## Approach
The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning classification algorithms to predict the diabetes status of an individual based on health data. Multiple classifiers will be tested, including:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of medical attributes for individuals, including features like age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc. Each record in the dataset is labeled with the diabetes status: whether the individual has diabetes or not.

##Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of each classifier, the following metrics will be used:
1. 4. False Positive Rate (FPR)
2. Precision
3. ROC-AUC
4. Error

The model that performs the best across these metrics will be considered as the most suitable classifier for predicting diabetes status.
